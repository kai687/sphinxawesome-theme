# About

This page describes the external assets of the Sphinx awesome theme
and topics that didn't fit anywhere else.

## Assets

The Sphinx awesome theme relies on the following assets.
You can check the complete list of dependencies
in the files `pyproject.toml` for Python dependencies and
`package.json` for JavaScript dependencies.

The icons are included as inline SVG in the HTML templates.
[Webpack] copies the fonts into the theme's static directory.
The CSS for the tooltips are in the file `tooltips.css` and
adapted for Tailwind.

## How does it work?

Sphinx themes are a collection of HTML templates, CSS styles, and JavaScript files.
Sphinx uses the [Jinja2] templating language.
The main template is in the file `layout.html`,
which defines the overall structure of the page,
and imports other components, such as the header or navigation menu.
The template file `page.html` is inherited from Sphinx's basic theme.
It extends the main `layout.html` template and renders the `body` text.

The Sphinx awesome theme defines a few internal extensions,
that add features like the code blocks.
An HTML postprocessing extension using [BeautifulSoup] changes the HTML
when modifying the Sphinx/docutils toolchain is too cumbersome.

## Package and project management

The project is distributed as a Python package.
The following tools are vital to achieve this:

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [Nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/)
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)

[Webpack] manages the JavaScript and CSS portions of the theme.
The entry point for Webpack is the file `app.js`.
All dependencies are imported here, including fonts and CSS.

Check the Webpack configuration file `webpack.config.js` for the full
pipeline.
