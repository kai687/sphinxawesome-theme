Version 6.0
-----------

Version 6.0 drops support for Python 3.8 and removes code that became deprecated in version 5.2.
This version also removes the light mode/dark mode selector.
Since dark mode is an operating-system setting,
having to control this additionally for every website seems like an anti-pattern.
