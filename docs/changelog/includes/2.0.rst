Version 2.0
-----------

Version 2.0 of the |product| includes these **breaking changes**:

Require Sphinx 4 or newer
   Sphinx 4 depends on docutils 0.17, which creates more semantic HTML by default.
   This allows to reduce the amount of custom transformations.

Restructure several templates
   The layout uses `CSS grid <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout>`_.
   This leads to fewer container elements in the templates.
