.. |version| replace:: 5.0

Version |version|
-----------------

Version |version| of the |product| is almost a complete rewrite.

Better navigation
   Version |version| has a clear separation between links to other pages (left sidebar),
   and links to sections on the current page (right sidebar).

Dark mode
   The theme follows a consistent design in light and dark mode.

Simpler setup
   You no longer need to load the theme as an extension.
   Like most other themes for Sphinx, it's enough to load it as ``html_theme``.

Redesign
   Using the design from `shadcn/ui <https://ui.shadcn.com/docs>`_.

.. _sec:upgrade-to-5.0:

Upgrade to version |version|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to upgrade the theme to version |version|,
you might need to update your Sphinx configuration.
To help you find deprecated options,
you can add the bundled ``sphinxawesome_theme.deprecated`` extension.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: |conf|

   extensions += ["sphinxawesome_theme.deprecated"]

The extension raises warnings if it finds deprecated options
and upgrades them to their new values if possible.

Deprecated options
++++++++++++++++++

The following two options don't have any effect in version |version|.
You can remove them from your Sphinx configuration:

``html_collapsible_definitions``
   This option provided a terrible user experience.
   After all, references are meant to be scanned, not hidden.
   You can use the `sphinx-design <https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
   extension instead and place single references inside a ``dropdown``.

``html_awesome_code_header``
   In most cases, the programming language of a code sample is already clear from its context.
   If you want to make more annotations, you can use existing mechanisms that are built into Sphinx,
   such as captions or comments at the top of a code block.
   For code samples in multiple languages, you can use the ``sphinx-design`` extension with its ``tab-set-code`` directive.

**DocSearch** is now an external extension, available as `sphinx-docsearch <https://sphinx-docsearch.readthedocs.io/>`_.

``html_awesome_docsearch``
   Load the bundled ``sphinxawesome_theme.docsearch`` extension instead.

These options are now keys in the ``html_theme_options`` dictionary
instead of top-level configuration options:

``html_awesome_headerlinks``
   Changed to ``awesome_headerlinks``

``html_awesome_external_links``
   Split into two options:

   - ``main_nav_links`` for text links in the header
   - ``extra_header_link_icon`` for icon links on the right side of the header.
