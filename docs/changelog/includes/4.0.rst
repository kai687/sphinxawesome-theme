Version 4.0
-----------

Version 4.0 of the |product| includes these **breaking changes**:

Add support for Sphinx 6
   Since Sphinx 6 is only supported with the latest version of the `myst-parser` package
   and Sphinx 6 drops support for Python 3.7, this release is a major version update.

Apart from that, this version is identical with version 3 of the |product|.
