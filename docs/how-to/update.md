inspired by the [Material Design](https://m2.material.io/) website.

Restructure
: All JavaScript is now using the
[Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) framework.

## Version 2.0

<!-- vale Google.WordList = YES -->

Version 2.0 of the {{ product }} includes these **major breaking changes**:

Require Sphinx 4 or newer
: Sphinx 4 depends on docutils 0.17, which creates more semantic HTML by default.
This allows to reduce the amount of custom transformations.

Restructure several templates
: The layout use
[CSS grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout).
This leads to fewer container elements in the templates.
