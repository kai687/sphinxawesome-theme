# How to configure the theme

```{rst-class} lead
Configure the theme by changing one of its options.
```

```{contents} On this page

local: true
backlinks: none

```

```{admonition} What's the difference between theme and extension options?
It's a technical distinction due to the way Sphinx builds a project.
Theme options are defined in the HTML template and only control layout/styling behavior.
Extension options are used when building the website, but before rendering tahe HTML.
```

## Theme options

You can configure the theme by modifying the `html_theme_options` dictionary in the
Sphinx configuration file `conf.py`.

:::{confval} nav_include_hidden

By default, the
[toctree](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-toctree)
directive includes the content and prints a list of links in the content area. A
`toctree` directive with the `:hidden:` option includes the content, but doesn't print
the list of links in the content area. This can be useful if navigation links are
elsewhere on the page. Printing the same list of links in the content area would be
redundant.

If you don't want to include elements from a _hidden_ toctree directive in the
navigation menu on the left, set:

```{code-block} python
---
caption: "File: conf.py"
---
# This option is `True` by default
html_theme_options = {"nav_include_hidden": False}
```

When using the `toctree` directive without the `:hidden:` option, insert a headline or
provide a caption with the `:caption:` option. For example:

```{code-block} rst
.. toctree::
   :caption: Contents
```

:::

:::{confval} show_nav

By default, the navigation links are shown in a navigation menu on the left side. If you
want to hide the navigation menu completely, add:

```{code-block} python
---
caption: "File: conf.py"
---
# This option is `True` by default
html_theme_options = {"show_nav": False}
```

:::

:::{confval} show_breadcrumbs

By default, "[breadcrumbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadcrumb_navigation)"
navigation links are shown at the top of the content area. They show the position of
this document relative to the top level. If you want to hide the breadcrumbs navigation
links, add:

```{code-block} python
---
caption: "File: conf.py"
---
# This option is `True` by default
html_theme_options = {"show_breadcrumbs": False}
```

:::

:::{confval} breadcrumbs_separator

If you want to select a different separator for the breadcrumbs navigation links,
set:

```{code-block} python
---
caption: "File: conf.py"
emphasize-text: CHAR
---
# The default separator is `/`
html_theme_options = {"breadcrumbs_separator": "CHAR"}
```

Replace {samp}`{CHAR}` with a character or HTML entity of your choice.
:::

:::{confval} show_prev_next

If you want to show links to the previous and next pages, set:

```{code-block} python
---
caption: "File: conf.py"
---
# This option is `False` by default
html_theme_options = {"show_prev_next": True}
```

In most cases, documentation isn't read from beginning to end. That's why this option is
turned off by default.
:::

<!-- vale Awesome.SpellCheck = NO -->

:::{confval} show_scrolltop

<!-- vale Awesome.SpellCheck = YES -->

For longer pages, scrolling to the top can be a hassle. If you want to show a button,
that scrolls to the top of the page when clicked, set:

```{code-block} python
---
caption: "File: conf.py"
---
# This option is `False` by default
html_theme_options = {"show_scrolltop": True}
```

:::

:::{confval} extra_header_links

If you want to add extra links to the header of your documentation, for example, similar
to what you can see on this page, set:

```{code-block} python
---
caption: "File: conf.py"
---
# This option is `False` by default
html_theme_options = {
  extra_header_links = {
    "link1": "/url1",
    "link2": "/url2",
  }
}
```

The keys of the `extra_header_links` dictionary are the link texts. The values are the
absolute URLs to the pages you want to link.

:::

(sec:extension-options)=

## Extension options

This theme also enables a few internal extensions that enhance the user experience. The
following configuration values are set at the top level in the Sphinx
configuration file `conf.py`:

<!-- vale Awesome.SpellCheck = NO -->

:::{confval} html_collapsible_definitions

<!-- vale Awesome.SpellCheck = YES -->

Set this option to `True` to make code references, such as classes, methods, and other
objects, collapsible and expandable. By default, this option is turned off.

```{code-block} python
---
caption: "File: conf.py"
---
# This option is `False` by default
html_collapsible_definitions = True
```

:::

<!-- vale Awesome.SpellCheck = NO -->

:::{confval} html_awesome_headerlinks

Set this option to `False` to restore Sphinx's default behavior for headerlinks.
Using this theme, clicking a headerlink immediately copies the URL to the clipboard.

<!-- vale Awesome.SpellCheck = YES -->

```{code-block} python
---
caption: "File: conf.py"
---
# This option is `True` by default
html_awesome_headerlinks = False
```
