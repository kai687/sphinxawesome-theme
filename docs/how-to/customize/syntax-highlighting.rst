Syntax highlighting
===================

.. rst-class:: lead

   Select different color schemes for syntax highlighting in code blocks.

.. tip::

   When selecting different color schemes,
   make sure that it works in all situations with sufficient contrast,
   for example, with line highlighting or with captions.
   Check the background colors and code block borders for overlaps.
