Install as a Python package
---------------------------

.. note::

   You're viewing the documentation for version |current| of the |product|,
   which is a **beta** release.
   That's why you have to add ``--pre`` to the installation command.
   To read the documentation for the latest stable release, see :doc:`v4:how-to/install/index`.

Install the latest **released version** from the Python Package Index
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/sphinxawesome-theme/>`_:

.. literalinclude:: ../install/includes/install.sh
   :language: bash

To install the latest **development version**, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/kai687/sphinxawesome-theme.git

After installing the theme, you can :doc:`add it to your project <../add/index>`.
