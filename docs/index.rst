generator. It includes a number of extensions that improve the usability.

   :start-after: features-start
   :end-before: features-end

These pages are divided into a *docs* and a *demo* section.

you can learn :ref:`How to install the theme`,
:ref:`How to use the theme`,
or :ref:`How to modify the theme` the theme.
The *demo* section acts as a style reference.
If a markup element isn't listed on one of the pages in the *demo* section,
it's likely that styles for it don't exist yet.
Create an issue on GitHub if you need styles for a certain
markup element, or add your own custom CSS.
