Sphinx awesome theme
====================

.. include:: ../README.rst
   :start-after: readme-start

These pages are divided into a *docs* and a *demo* section.
In the *docs* section,
you can learn :ref:`How to install the theme`,
:ref:`How to use the theme`,
or :ref:`How to modify the theme`.
The *demo* section acts as a style reference.
If a markup element isn't listed on one of the pages in the *demo* section,
it's likely that styles for it don't exist yet.
Create an issue on GitHub if you need styles for a certain
markup element, or add your own custom CSS.

The Sphinx awesome theme is open-source software and distributed under the MIT license.
The source code is available on GitHub_.
