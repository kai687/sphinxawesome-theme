Lists

   See how lists appear in the |product|.

Unordered lists
---------------

Choose an unordered, or bulleted, list, when the order of items doesn't matter.

.. vale Vale.Spelling = NO

- item a
- item b

  - subitem a

    This is an example with multiple paragraphs.

    Although there are only 3.

  - subitem b
  - subitem c

- item c

Ordered lists
-------------

Choose an ordered list,
when the order of the items matters.
For example, use ordered lists in step-by-step instructions.

#. Step 1
#. Step 2

   #. Substep 1

      This is an example with multiple paragraphs.

      Although there are only 3.

   #. Substep 2
   #. Substep 3

#. Step 3

.. vale Vale.Spelling = YES

Definition lists
----------------

Use definition lists for describing terms and their definitions.

Term a
   Definition for term a.

   We need a few more paragraphs to test something.

   Specifically, the spacing within these elements.

Term b
   Definition for term b. How about a quote in a definition list?

       This is supposed to be a quote.
       Is the spacing okay?

Term c
   Definition for term c.
