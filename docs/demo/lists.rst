Definition lists
----------------

Use definition lists for describing terms and their definitions.

Term a
   Definition for term a

Term b
   Definition for term b. How about a quote in a definition list?

       This is supposed to be a quote.
       Is the spacing okay?

Term c
   Definition for term c.
