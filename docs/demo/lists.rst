Lists
=====

Lists, well, list multiple things. Lists work well for one-dimensional categories. When
you want to list things in two dimensions, choose a table instead. There are three basic
category of lists.

---------------
Unordered lists
---------------

Choose an unordered, or bulleted, list, when the order of items don't matter.

- item a
- item b

  - subitem a
  - subitem b
  - subitem c

- item c

Ordered lists
-------------

Choose an ordered list,
when the order of the items matter.
For example, in most cases
you need to perform the second step
*after* the first step,
and so on.

#. Step 1
#. Step 2

   #. Substep 1
   #. Substep 2
   #. Substep 3

#. Step 3

Definition lists
----------------

A nice way of describing categories is via definition lists. Think of it as an unordered
list with additional explanations to each item.

Term a
   Definition for term a

Term b
   Definition for term b. How about a quote in a definition list?

       This is supposed to be a quote.
       Is the spacing okay?

Term c
   Definition for term c.
