On-page navigation
==================

To display only content of the current page,
use the ``contents`` directive with the ``:local:`` option.
You must provide a title for the directive to render.
It silently fails to render otherwise.
By default, headings included after this directive are links back to the contents section
(such as on this page).
If you want to turn off this behavior,
use ``:backlinks: none``.
