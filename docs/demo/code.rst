Code blocks and inline code
===========================

This page shows styles for inline markup related to code,
as well as for the additional features of code blocks.

Inline Code
-----------

You can mark up generic inline code using two backticks
like this: ``inline code``.

Syntax highlighted inline code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use syntax highlighting for inline code,
such as this: :python:`print("Hello World")`,
perform these steps:

#. Create docutils configuration file :file:`docutils.conf`.

   Place this file in the same directory as the Sphinx configuration
   file :file:`conf.py`.

#. Make the syntax highlighter use *short* class names.

   Add this section to the file :file:`docutils.conf`:

   .. code-block:: ini
      :caption: docutils.conf

      [restructuredtext parser]
      syntax_highlight = short

   This creates "short" class names for syntax highlighting,
   the same as used by Sphinx's code blocks.

#. Define custom interpreted text roles using docutils :rst:`role` directive.

   For each language you want to highlight, create a custom interpreted text role.
   For example, to highlight inline Python code, add this to the beginning of the
   reStructuredText file:

   .. code-block:: rst

      .. role:: python(code)
        :language: python
        :class: highlight

   This adds the class ``highlight`` to the list of classes for the inline code,
   which automatically applies the same styles as for code blocks.

#. Use the new role to markup and highlight inline code.

   For example:

   .. code-block:: rst

      :python:`print("Hello World")`

   renders into :python:`print("Hello World")`.

.. note::

   Inline syntax highlighting is performed by the docutils module
   on which Sphinx is based. Sphinx doesn't provide or extend this
   feature, which means the user needs to perform these additional
   steps.

More interpreted text roles for code-like elements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Docutils and Sphinx come with many interpreted text roles
to mark up specific elements.
This theme only provides styles for a few of these roles.

Files can be marked up with the :rst:`file` interpreted text role.

.. code-block:: rst

   :file:`Some filename`

This is rendered as :file:`Some filename`.

You can highlight inline code with placeholders
using the :rst:`samp` interpreted text role.

.. code-block:: rst

   :samp:`Replace {PLACEHOLDER}`

This is rendered as :samp:`Replace {PLACEHOLDER}`.
The same placeholder syntax can also be used with the :rst:`file` role.

Keyboard shortcuts can be entered using the :rst:`kbd` interpreted text role.

.. code-block:: rst

   :kbd:`Ctrl+F`

This is rendered as :kbd:`Ctrl+F`.

Interpreted text roles for GUI documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Graphical user interface elements are often rendered in a bold font,
in contrast to the monospace font for code elements.
Use the :rst:`guilabel` role to document buttons and other
user interface elements.

.. code-block:: rst

   :guilabel:`Help`

This renders as :guilabel:`Help`.

Use the :rst:`menuselection` role to document items in menus.

.. code-block:: rst

   :menuselection:`Start --> Program`

This renders as :menuselection:`Start --> Program`.

Awesome code blocks
-------------------

You can render code blocks using the :rst:`code-block` directive.
If you don't specify a language as an argument to the code block,
the default highlighting language is used.

For example:

.. code-block:: python

   print("Hello World")

uses the Python lexer of Pygments to apply syntax highlighting.
Use the :rst:`highlight` directive to set the default highlighting language
on a per-document basis. See
`highlight directive <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-highlight>`_
for more information.
Use the :rst:`highlight_language` configuration setting to set the default
highlighting language for the whole project. See
`highlight_language <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-highlight_language>`_
for more information.

All code blocks have a header section with a :guilabel:`Copy` button.
Clicking the button copies the text inside the code block to the clipboard.
The header also contains a label for the highlighting language as well as
the caption.

.. caution::

   For interactive shell sessions, Pygments provides the ``shell-session``
   lexer, with an alias of ``console``. The former is too long and the
   latter to old-fashioned for my taste.

   This theme replaces the label ``console`` with the label ``shell``
   in the header section of code blocks. Unfortunately, ``shell`` is
   also an alias for shell scripts. As shell scripts are likely to
   be specific to a certain type of shell, I recommend being more
   specific, such as using ``sh``, ``bash``, or ``zsh``.

   If no highlighting language is defined, Sphinx uses ``default``,
   which is translated to python (or interactive python session),
   so this theme replaces ``default`` with ``python`` in the header
   section.

The following example shows a code block for JavaScript with a caption.

.. code-block:: javascript
   :caption: Example code

   console.log("Hello World")

Use the ``linenos`` option to show line numbers in the code block.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   for i in range(3):
      print(f"{i} line of code")

To emphasize specific lines in code blocks,
use the ``:emphasize-lines:`` option:

.. code-block:: bash
   :emphasize-lines: 2

   echo "Don't emphasize this"
   echo "Emphasize this"
   echo "Don't emphasize this either"

Likewise, you can emphasize code changes using the ``:emphasize-added:``
and ``:emphasize-removed:`` options.

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-removed: 1
   :emphasize-added: 2

   print("red")
   print("green")
   print("regular highlighting is applied")

Note, how the lines are still highlighted using Python syntax.
Copy the code and note, how the ``+`` and ``-`` characters aren't
copied.

.. note::

   The ``:emphasize-added:`` and ``:emphasize-removed:`` options
   only work in this theme. If you later change the theme, leaving
   these options generate a warning and skip rendering all code
   blocks with these options. I recommend using ``sphinx-build -W``
   to turn warnings into errors.

A portable, built-in alternative is to use Pygments' ``diff`` lexer.

.. code-block:: diff

   + print("red")
   - print("green")
     print("no highlighting is applied here")

This works with all themes, but doesn't highlight the other lines
in the code block. When selecting the code to copy to the clipboard,
the ``+`` and ``-`` characters at the beginning are copied as well.

The following example is for testing the previous options with line numbers:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-removed: 2
   :emphasize-added: 3
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   print("One line of code")
   print("Removed line of code")
   print("Added line of code")
   print("Emphasized line of code")
   print("Normal line of code")

There is currently one visual bug with emphasizing lines
`#171 <https://github.com/kai687/sphinxawesome-theme/issues/171>`_.

For example:

.. code-block::
   :caption: Really long line
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   print("A shorter line of code.")
   print("And a really long line of code that should overflow the container on most screen sizes which illustrates the issue.")


Code blocks can't contain any markup, such as bold text or hyperlinks.

Parsed literal blocks
---------------------

If you want to write blocks of literal text containing any markup,
such as bold text or hyperlinks, use a :rst:`parsed-literal` directive.

.. parsed-literal::

   This *can* contain markup, but **not** syntax highlighting.

You can't use syntax highlighting with :rst:`parsed-literal` blocks.

Samp directive
--------------

If you want to highlight placeholder variables, and you can accept
only minimal highlighting, you can use the :rst:`samp` directive.

For example:

.. code-block:: rst
   :caption: samp directive

   .. samp::

      $ echo "Enter {PLACEHOLDER}"

is rendered as:

.. samp::

   $ echo "Enter {PLACEHOLDER}"

.. note::

   The Sphinx awesome theme provides a style for the directive
   that integrates well with the rest of the theme. The parsing
   is handled by a separate extension
   `sphinxawesome-sampdirective <https://github.com/kai687/sphinxawesome-sampdirective>`_.
   This extension is automatically installed and loaded,
   if the Sphinx awesome theme is installed as a Python package.
   See :ref:`How to install the theme` for more information.

   You can install and activate the extension separately for using
   with other themes.
