"""Post-process the HTML produced by Sphinx.

Some modifications can be done more easily on the finished HTML.

This module defines a simple pipeline:

1. Read all HTML files
2. Parse them with `BeautifulSoup`
3. Perform a chain of actions on the tree in place

See the `_modify_html()` function for the list of
transformations.

Note: This file is not processed by Webpack; don't use Tailwind utility classes.
They might not show up in the final CSS.
