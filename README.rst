Features
--------

This theme is designed with readability and usability in mind.
The theme includes several extensions that enhance the usability:

Awesome code blocks
    - Code blocks have a header section, displaying the optional caption,
      as well as the programming language used for syntax highlighting
    - The code block headers contain a **Copy** button, allowing you to copy
      code snippets to the clipboard.
    - The theme adds two new options to Sphinx's ``code-block`` directive:
      ``emphasize-added`` and ``emphasize-removed``, allowing you to highlight
      code changes within other highlighted code.

Awesome new directive for highlighting placeholder variables
    The theme supports a new directive ``samp``, which is the equivalent of the
    built-in ``:samp:`` interpreted text role. This allows you to highlight placeholder
    variables in code blocks.

Awesome user experience improvements
    These small features make the theme more usable. To name a few:

    - better keyboard navigation:

      - use the ``Tab`` key to navigate through all sections on the page
      - use the *Skip to Content* link to bypass the navigation links
      - use the ``/`` key (forward Slash) to focus the search input element

    - better “permalink” mechanism:

      - hovering over an element with a permalink reveals a *Link* icon
      - selecting the *Link* icon copies the link to the clipboard
      - notes, warnings and other admonitions have permalinks by default

    - collapsible elements:

      - nested navigation links – all pages are reachable from all other pages
      - code definitions – code object definitions (functions, classes, modules, etc.), for example obtained via the ``sphinx.ext.autodoc`` extension.
